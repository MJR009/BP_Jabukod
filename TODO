- Resolve CMake warnings
- Add a "cleanall" target to remove build dir
- Add a LICENCE file (if needed)
- GRAMMAR:
    - UNICODE (\Uxxxx)
    - better escape sequences
    - CHECK IF RULES AREN'T UNNESERALI NESTING
    - enums
    - nil
    - correctness of int, float literals
    - exponential format of float
    - UNARY MINUS FOR CONSTANTS OR NEGATIVE LITERALS ???
    - LISTS
    - check precedences
    - expression vs. assignment
    - minus sign for literals - simplify

- text: in case of inconsistencies, inspiration was taken from actual C.g4 grammar
-- bring up interesting snippets, like the way ';' are delt with in "statement" nonterminal (this specifically was inspired by C.g4)
-- declaration needen at least for good use of foreach
-- unary minus with constant taken straight as a negative number to avoid parsing as an expression
-- unary plus feels like it is not important
-- decision was made to not allow leaading zeros with numbers
