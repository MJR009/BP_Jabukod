- Resolve CMake warnings
- Add a LICENCE file (if needed)
- GRAMMAR:
    - UNICODE (\Uxxxx)
    - Hex numbers
    - Floats
    - Should any number of leading zeros be allowed?
    - better escape sequences
    - constants, static
    - CHECK IF RULES AREN'T UNNESERALI NESTING
    - enums
    - nil
    - correctness of int, float literals
    - exponential format of float
    - variable declaration
    - UNARY MINUS FOR CONSTANTS OR NEGATIVE LITERALS ???
    - LISTS
    - unary + and i associativity
    - STATEMENTS !!!
    - check precedences
    - block without possibility of jump statements (if without continue...)
    - statement block -> statement doesn't eat ';'
    - for and foreach header correctness
    - expression vs. assignment
    - foreach must support declarations

- text: in case of inconsistencies, inspiration was taken from actual C.g4 grammar
-- bring up interesting snippets, like the way ';' are delt with in "statement" nonterminal (this specifically was inspired by C.g4)
